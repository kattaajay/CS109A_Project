    "In this work, shank and foot accelerometer and gyroscope were used to classify walking into 5 walking conditions: uphill, downhill, stair ascent, stair descent, and level ground walking. The data is assembled from 10 gait cycles of each walking condition collected at speeds ranging from 1.4 m/s to 1.47 m/s. Particuarly, preswing phase signals were used to make the classifications. The data was pre-processed using a butterworht filter and maximums and minimums of each sensor signal were extracted as separate predictors. \n",

    "The authors built a support vector classifier which out performed other popular methods, such as artificial neural network and Baysian belief network. A SVM classifier was chosen because it is flexible and can adjust the balance between variance and bias by adjust the margin. Using RBF kernel also allowed data to be mapped on to higher dimensional space. The optimal hyperparameters were chosen using kFold cross validation.\n",

    "In conclusion, the stair ascent and descent classification accuracies were 100%, and the authors noted that adding foot gyros improved the classification rate from 78% to 84%."

    "In this work, a Gaussian Mixture Model was used to predict 7 different gradient surfaces. 12 subjects were tested in total and a set of 13 features were extracted for prediction. \n",

    "During walking experiments, a single triaxial accelerometer was placed at the waist, and video recordings were collected for segmenting the gait in post processing. The subjects were instructed to walk on paved ground or wair way. Each subject walked with their preferrered step length but at a constant step rate fixed by a metronome.\n",

    "For the GMM, the optimal number of Gaussian functions required was determined to be 4. 100 iterations were used to maximize the expectation in training. The performance of the classifier was also evaluated using six-fold cross-validation. The data was divided into subsets without spliting data from each subject. \n",
