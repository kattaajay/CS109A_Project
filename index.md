**Motivation:**

The dog's market has grown a lot in the past years and having the task to identify a dog breed with acceptable accuracy has become a quite challenge, especially for businesses dedicated to sell products tailored for breed type. 

However, it is quite difficult to identify a dog breed by simply looking at it, some of the dog breeds are very complex to identify by human eye because they have been combined with other breeds or multiple breeds look alike a complex task for human eye; this includes experts and veterinaries.

On another hand, shelters and veterinary clinics have been struggling with this particular task which in some cases may result in a bad decision. For this reason, we came up with a set of models to help predict and classify dog breeds with an acceptable accuracy just by looking into its image. 

The model uses fully connected networks (FCN) as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) to improve accuracy while predicting the images.
