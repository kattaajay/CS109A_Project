**Motivation:**

The dog's market has grown a lot in the past years and having the task to identify a dog breed accuraly has become a quite challenge, especially for business selling products taylored for dog breeds. 

We are taking this opportunity to create a model to help this business industry to identify dog breeds. As explained earlier, it is quite a challenge to identify a dog breed by simply looking at it. Some of the dog breeds are very difficult to identify by human eye because they have been either combined with other breeds or several breeds just look alike. For this reason, it is a complex task to identify a dog breed just by using human eye; this includes experts and veterinarians which share the same challenge.

Furthermore, shelters and veterinary clinics have been strugleling with this particular task which in some cases may result in a bad decision. For this reason, we have came up with  a set of models to help predict and classify dog breeds more accuraly just by looking into its image.

The model uses fully connected networks (FCN) as well as convulational neural networks (CNN) to improve accuracy while predicting the images.
