**Motivation:**

The dog's market has grown a lot in the past years and having the task to identify a dog breed accuraly has become a quite challenge especially for businesses selling products taylored for breed type. 

However, it is quite difficult to identify a dog breed by simply looking at it, some of the dog breeds are very complex to identify by human eye because they have been combined with other breeds or  multiple breeds look alike a complex task for human eye; this includes experts and veterinaries.

On another hand, shelters and veterinary clinics have been strugleling with this particular task which in some cases may result in a bad decision. For this reason, we have came up with  a set of modesl to help predict and classify dog breeds more accuraly just by looking into its image. 

The model uses fully connected networks (FCN) as well as convulational neural networks (CNN) to improve accuracy while predicting the images.
